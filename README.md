## Description

  This daily planner is designed to help busy employees effectively manage their time by adding important events to their schedule. Upon opening the planner, users are greeted with the current day displayed prominently at the top of the calendar. As they scroll down, timeblocks for standard business hours are presented, each color-coded to indicate whether it's in the past, present, or future. Users can easily enter events into specific timeblocks, and with a simple click of the save button, the event text is stored in local storage, ensuring that the saved events persist even after refreshing the page. With its intuitive interface and reliable functionality, this daily planner is a valuable tool for optimizing productivity and organizing daily tasks.
